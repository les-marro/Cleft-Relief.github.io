            Mision Caritas Felices is a non-profit organization, founded and formed by Peruvian volunteers during 15
            years. They are responsible for helping patients born with cleft lip in order to achieve their total
            rehabilitation. So far they have operated on more than 2000 low-income patients thanks to the group of
            volunteer doctors and donations from private companies and Smile Train
